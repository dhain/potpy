PotPy
=====

PotPy lets you build applications in a very flexible way. You design objects
based on your domain requirements, then compose them together using PotPy's
flexible routing system. PotPy enables you to:

* **Write simple, decoupled objects** that work together in various ways.
* **Easily test your objects**, by not imposing a rigid object construction
  paradigm.
* **Write WSGI components using TDD**, without having to deal with WSGI
  conventions except at the edges of the system.
